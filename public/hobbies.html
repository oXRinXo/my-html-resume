    <h1>Time to get personal</h1>
    <p>
        While my job is a huge part of my life, there is definitely more to me than just being a designer and (hopefully soon to be) web developer. <br>
        So here are some things you might want to know about me

    <h2>Gaming</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a passionate gamer and enjoy fantasy video games a lot. <br>
        My favourite games at the moment are:
        <ol>
            <li>Genshin Impact</li>
            <li>Honkai Star Rail</li>
            <li>Guild Wars 2</li>
            <li>Kena - Bridge of Spirits</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>Cooking</h2>
    <p>
        I absolutely love cooking, especially Japanese and Korean food. Since I'm vegan, I often try to figure out how to substitute ingredients without loosing the original flavour. <br>
        If you want to check out what I cook, jump over to my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/regina_bu_/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> and have a look. <br>
        Also, here's some ramen I made: <br>

    <h2>Sculpting and Art</h2>
    <p>
        I have always been an artistic person. I started drawing as soon as I was able to hold a pencil. And I have done so ever since. That's also the reason I chose to study design and work as a designer. <br>
        Also, I recently started learning soapstone carving. If you are interested in what I make, follow my <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@just.rin.gg" target="_blank">TikTok Account</a> where I will be uploading sculpting videos
